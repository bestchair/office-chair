<p>Cyclohexane is the most widely occurring ring in compounds of natural origin. The Boat Conformation of cyclohexane is created when two carbon atoms on opposite sides of the six-membered ring are both lifted up out of the plane of the ring creating a shape which slightly resembles a boatThe boat conformation is less stable than the chair form for two major reasons. The molecule of cyclohexane can easily switch between all these conformations. This too is almost free of angle strain but in contrast has torsional strain associated with eclipsed bonds at the four of the C atoms that form the side of the boat. The boat conformation is quite flexible.</p>

However they retain the corresponding up or down positions. Created by Sal KhanWatch the next lesson. Allylic strain energetics related to rotation about the single bond between an sp 2. The boat conformation has unfavorable steric interactions between. By flexing to a new formthe twist conformation Fig5the boat conformation can relieve some of its torsional strain and at the same time reduce the flagpole interactions.</p>

<p>Chemistry Solution Chemistry Education Chemistry Organic Chemistry The boat conformation comes from partial C-C bond rotations only flipping one carbon up to convert the chair to a boat of the chair conformation and all the carbons still have 1095Âº bond angles so there are no angle strains. Cyclohexane can form three different conformations. The terms chair conformation and boat conformation come under organic chemistry and they are mainly applicable to cyclohexaneThese are two different structures in which the cyclohexane molecule can exist but they have different stabilities. Of the boat can be relieved by twisting. With help of the diagram below explain the existence of multiple stable conformations for a cyclohexane for example the chair and the twist-boat. There is only one chair conformation of cis-14-dimethylcyclohexane.</p>

The lowest energy conformation is chair conformation. This too is almost free of angle strain but in contrast has torsional strain associated with eclipsed bonds at the four of the C atoms that form the side of the boat. Figure 43a Boat conformation of cyclohexane. The two conformations are identical. When chair flipping occurs axial carbon-hydrogen bonds become equatorial and the equatorial carbon-hydrogen bonds become axial.</p>

The boat conformation of cyclohexane is not a very stable. This means that cyclohexane has the same stability as a typical unbranched alkane. The twist boat conformation is about 5 kcalmol 21 kJmol less stable than the chair conformation. There is only one chair conformation of cis-14-dimethylcyclohexane.
