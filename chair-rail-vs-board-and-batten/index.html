Designers use a wide plate rail to replace the chair rail and to offer a better platform for the decorative objects. You can just measure up off your base.

Chair rail is a decorative interior wood wall molding that is attached horizontally around the perimeter of a room.</p>

A short video describing the method to measure and cut non-standard chair rail wainscoting angles using simple hand tools. We filled in all of the holes with putty and caulked any gaps to give it a finished look. Some people install 4-foot wide hardwood veneer plywood panels but the height can rise to over 6 foot.

<p>What Needs To Be Done To Finish Dining Room Home Remodeling Wainscoting Styles Remodel Bedroom The first was to make the baseboard look much thicker and fancy but the most important reason is because we needed a flat 1 inch surface at the top of the baseboard so that when we added the board and batten style the wood would be flush against each other. There is usually a chair rail along the top edge. For the batten part I used 8 foot lattice strips that cost under 100 at Home Depot or Lowe. Normal chair rail height is between 32 and 36. The most common board and batten design a top and bottom board with evenly spaced vertical boards in between.
