However it is common for employees and shareholders of the company to use the word chairman for the person holding this post rather than calling him chairman of the board. The relationship between the board chair and CEO is critical. The board chair is focused on high-level strategic planning with the board while the executive director is more hands-on. Both are now in wide use probably chair more commonly. As I mentioned above for your convenience I created a one-page overview of the roles of the board chair and Executive Director.</p>

Board Chair is used especially where there is a full-time CEO of a large organization such as a university a hospital or a major foundation who is given the title of President to reflect his or her status as the top executive. This is the board member who is chosen by the board to run board meetings and lead the board in other ways. Probably the only way to express it that will not upset anybody is to avoid the noun altogether.
