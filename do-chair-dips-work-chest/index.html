<p>Pin On Time To Make A Change Will this type of exercise work the chest. This method works great at the end of a session where youd use higher rep ranges and perform the reps with a little faster tempo than normal without getting sloppy. Dips come in a number of variations and names including triceps dips chest dips chair dips bench dips and reverse dips depending on how they are performed. Whether you have your own parallel bars a gym membership or some furniture that you can do the motion from chest dips. During triceps dips that primary mover is as youd expect the triceps. Although both target the upper body and work the same areas by changing our position slightly we can change the emphasis on different parts of the upper body switching between targeting more of the back of the tricep and targeting the lower chest.</p>

<p>A Work In Progress Workout Fitness Body Exercise The single-chair dip is a compound exercise meaning it targets more than one muscle group at a time. Dips are a very effective overall chest exercise but they do not emphasize the upper chest because the pressing happens at a downward angle facilitating the recruitment of the lower pectoral fibers rather than the uppers.
