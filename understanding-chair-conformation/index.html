<p>Chemistry The most stable chemical conformation of a six-membered single bonded carbon ring such cyclohexane. Notes for Newman projections of the chair conformation refer to the drawing below. Best chair configuration for trimethylcyclohexane matching a specific Haworth projection. This video walks you through the ring flip and boat conformations both with a model kit as well as how to draw the ring flip and boat on paper. The fundamental understanding of the conformations of cyclohexane and the structures of molecules containing cyclohexane ring was developed by Derek H R Barton and Odd Hassel who shared the Nobel Prize in 1969.</p>

The a or e bonds on four carbons C1 C2 C4 and C5 are shown explicitly while the bonds on C3 and C6 are just. The C-C-C bonds are very close to 1095 o so it is almost free of angle strain. Even if you dont care for the styles if youre designing your own chair in a different style it may still help you to see where the old masters reckoned there ought to be support. Here we have one chair conformation of methylcyclohexane and this is carbon one you can see we have a methyl group that is axial up at carbon one we also have a hydrogen and Ive made the hydrogen green so we can tell apart from the other hydrogens and this hydrogen is equatorial down at carbon one now this chair conformation is in equilibrium with another chair conformation and we can get to the other chair conformation.</p>

The free energy ΔG of the equilibrium process going from one conformer to the other ie from A to B as shown in step 4 or 5 can be calculated from the equation below where the. Although the hydrocarbon cyclohexane is typically drawn as if it were flat in reality the structure is not flat at all. Cyclohexanes are most stable in the chair conformation. Rotate the molecule in the JSMOL image to show this just like a Newman projection so. If the bond angles were signiﬁcantly distorted from tetrahedral we would expect to see a greater.</p>

The following guidelines can be used to determine the percent distribution of two chair conformers using the Gibbs free energy equation and some simple algebra. The C-C-C bonds are very close to 1095 o so it is almost free of angle strain.</p>

Every carbon on the chair conformation has. Practice drawing cyclohexanes as line-angle structures from names converting to chair forms grappling with chair flips and judging the relative stability. Here we have one chair conformation of methylcyclohexane and this is carbon one you can see we have a methyl group that is axial up at carbon one we also have a hydrogen and Ive made the hydrogen green so we can tell apart from the other hydrogens and this hydrogen is equatorial down at carbon one now this chair conformation is in equilibrium with another chair conformation and we can get to the other chair conformation. Although the hydrocarbon cyclohexane is typically drawn as if it were flat in reality the structure is not flat at all.

<p>Chair Conformations Science Rules Chemistry Organic Chemistry Notes for Newman projections of the chair conformation refer to the drawing below. This video walks you through the ring flip and boat conformations both with a model kit as well as how to draw the ring flip and boat on paper. This conformation is called the chair because it looks sort of like a reclining lounge chair as shown here. The vertical red C-H bonds are the a bonds the flat blue C-H bonds are the e bonds.
