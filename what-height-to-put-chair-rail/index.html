<p>Chair Rail Height Molding For Chair Rails Thats where the chair rail belongs. Available in a number of designs from classic to cutting edge and adaptable to any homes color palette chair rail molding is a seemingly minute detail that makes a night and day difference. Chair railing was popular to protect plaster walls from of all things the backs of chairs bashing gouges in it. Once youve determined the height use your tape measure and level to make a level line along the whole length of the room. If your walls were 8 feet the standard height would be 32 inches. The general rule is that the chair rail should be about 13 of the way up from the floor between 32 and 36 for an 8 ceiling.</p>

<p>What Is The Standard Chair Rail Height Chair railing was popular to protect plaster walls from of all things the backs of chairs bashing gouges in it. The standard chair rail height recommendation is about one-third the height of the wall but various factors come into play that may affect the height you choose. In the day vanities were 30 high. For me a good rule of thumb is to install chair rail molding at 25 of the height of the room. So youll have to raise the chair rail somewhere between 28 30 and self-return it onto the casing do NOT back cut the chair rail at the windowdoor casing.

<p>The Misused Confused Chair Rail Thisiscarpentry In the day vanities were 30 high. Rachael Turner from Front Porch Properties is here to talk about choosing the right chair rail height. Ensure that the rail is horizontal and at the desired height above the floor. In a room with a 10-foot-high ceiling the chair rail should be 30 inches off the floor. The final trim you see a lot in antique homes is picture frame trim around the top&mdash;separate or part of the crown installation. Measure that distance up from the floor.</p>
