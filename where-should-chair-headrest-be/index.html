<p>Ergonomic Office Chair High Back Desk Chair Adjustable Headrest With Tilt Function Lumbar Support Office Chair Ergonomic Desk Chair High Back Office Chair Chair needs a headrest period Seating area needs to be deeper than the Steelcase Gesture which feels at least 3 too short for me The chair needs to be comfortable both for computer work but also for lounging watching a move or playing a game where the posture is going to be more reclined and more slouch I hated that about the Embody very uncomfortable for lounging IMO. Passive adjustment headrests on. Ergonomically designed office chairs with headrests stop you from hunching forwards. The Steelcase Think Chair is just as popular as the Leap. If it doesnt match then you wont be able to install it. The best position is always the next position and a headrest helps facilitate that.</p>
